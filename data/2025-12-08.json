  "ai_insights": "Pattern Detection:\nToday's activity is entirely focused on personal practice within the `LeetCode-Attempts` repository, using Java. This is a significant shift from the recent polyglot work (TypeScript, Python) across multiple project repositories like `Insightify`, `Hygieia-Frontend`, and `Hygieia-Backend`. The pace is extremely slow, with 2 commits across 0.5h, well below your average of 9 commits/day.\n\nRed Flags:\nThe primary red flag is the complete abandonment of project work. The commit messages \"[LeetCode-Attempts] Time: 11 ms (86.17%) | Memory: 12.4 MB (51.77%) - LeetSync\" and \"[LeetCode-Attempts] Added README.md file for Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range\" clearly indicate personal LeetCode problem-solving, not contributing to company objectives. Your productivity is abysmal compared to your average, suggesting you were disengaged from your assigned tasks.\n\nBrutal Truth:\nYou spent company time solving LeetCode problems instead of contributing to `Insightify`, `Hygieia-Frontend`, or `Hygieia-Backend`. This is unacceptable; focus on your actual job responsibilities."
