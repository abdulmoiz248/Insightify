Longest streak: 9 days shows your discipline level. Consistent practice builds muscle memory, sporadic coding doesn't.\n\n## Skill Development Analysis\nWorking across 10 repositories with 9 languages (primary: TypeScript). moderate spread - consider finishing a few projects completely. Top projects: Fynix, LeetCode-Attempts, Abdul-Moiz. Deep understanding comes from completing projects, not starting many.\n\n## Reality Check (What's Actually Happening)\n- Touching 10 repos this month - are you learning deeply or just dabbling?\n\n## What You Need to Do\n- Pick your top project (Fynix) and finish it completely before touching others\n- Focus on mastering TypeScript before jumping to other languages - depth beats breadth when learning",
