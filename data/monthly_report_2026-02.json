Longest streak: 4 days shows your discipline level. Consistent practice builds muscle memory, sporadic coding doesn't.\n\n## Skill Development Analysis\nWorking across 5 repositories with 4 languages (primary: TypeScript). good focus - building depth through concentrated effort. Top projects: LeetCode-Attempts, Hygieia-Frontend, Hygieia-Backend. Deep understanding comes from completing projects, not starting many.\n\n## Reality Check (What's Actually Happening)\n- Only 10/27 active days - you're not building the daily coding habit that accelerates learning\n- Longest streak is 4 days - where's the discipline? Consistency compounds\n\n## What You Need to Do\n- Code every single day, even just 30 mins - you're at 37.0%, aim for 80%+\n- Build a 7+ day streak (current: 4) - daily practice is non-negotiable for real skill growth\n- Focus on mastering TypeScript before jumping to other languages - depth beats breadth when learning",
