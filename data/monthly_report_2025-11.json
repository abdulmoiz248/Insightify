Longest streak: 3 days shows your discipline level. Consistent practice builds muscle memory, sporadic coding doesn't.\n\n## Skill Development Analysis\nWorking across 4 repositories with 3 languages (primary: TypeScript). good focus - building depth through concentrated effort. Top projects: Hygieia-Backend, Hygieia-Frontend, Insightify. Deep understanding comes from completing projects, not starting many.\n\n## Reality Check (What's Actually Happening)\n- Longest streak is 3 days - where's the discipline? Consistency compounds\n\n## What You Need to Do\n- Build a 7+ day streak (current: 3) - daily practice is non-negotiable for real skill growth",
