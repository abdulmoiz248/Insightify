  "ai_insights": "## Performance Reality Check\nYour engagement for November was a mere 40%, with only 12 out of 30 days showing activity. This is subpar. Your 96 commits over 45.64 hours translates to a highly inefficient 2.1 commits/hour, far below professional standards and indicative of significant wasted time during logged \"coding hours.\" The longest commit streak of 3 days, despite 12 active days, clearly highlights a critical lack of sustained consistency.\n\n## Technical Depth & Focus\nWhile TypeScript shows primary focus with 81 commits, the distribution across four repositories - Hygieia-Backend, Hygieia-Frontend, Insightify, and leetcode-daily - suggests a critical lack of dedicated focus. Spreading 96 commits thinly across this many projects, especially with secondary contributions to Python (12 commits) and Java (3 commits), raises concerns that you are not effectively driving any single project to completion. This pattern implies jumping between tasks rather than deep, impactful work.\n\n## Critical Issues\n*   **Consistency Gaps:** Your active day count of 12/30 days (40%) combined with a 3-day longest streak demonstrates severe irregularity. The weekly commit trend from Week 46 (31 commits) to Week 49 (9 commits) further confirms a decaying, inconsistent effort throughout the month.\n*   **Productivity Concerns:** A rate of 2.1 commits/hour is unacceptably low. This implies either significant unproductive time during reported coding hours or an unhealthy habit of batching large amounts of work into single, infrequent commits, which hinders continuous integration and review processes.\n*   **Scope/Focus Problems:** Distributing a low total of 96 commits across four distinct repositories, particularly Hygieia-Backend, Hygieia-Frontend, and Insightify, dilutes your impact. This indicates an inability to prioritize and commit meaningfully to primary project objectives.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n*   Increase your active days to at least 20 per month (66%+ engagement) by committing daily, even for minor changes.\n*   Boost commit frequency to a minimum of 4 commits/hour, ensuring smaller, more atomic commits that facilitate continuous integration and code review.\n*   Consolidate your efforts immediately. Focus exclusively on Hygieia-Backend and Hygieia-Frontend; any work on Insightify or leetcode-daily must cease until the core product work demonstrates consistent, high-quality progress.",
